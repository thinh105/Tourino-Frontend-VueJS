## Bug

- [ ] Deadlock : Watcher watch Selection change to visit the desired URL ~> URL set selection chip ~~> watcher try to revisit that URL again

- [ ] Visit link on cards does not load the filter chip

## TODO

- [ ] Vue Router - the chip filter will not update when go back old page

  - [x] Filter: Now the chip selections are sync to URL.

User now can visit the copy/reload URL and still get the chip selections

## Project setup
